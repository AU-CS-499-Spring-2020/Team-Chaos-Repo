					<h3>What is an Automaton</h3>
					<p>An automaton is a machine which takes an input and then releases an output. 
						These inputs normally consist of an individual character or a number. 
						Automatons are made up of a series of states and transistions that allow its 
						input to be easily transformed to the specified output. These outputs can range 
						from anything as simple as an character or number to complex concepts including
						point cordinates. 
					</p>
					<h3>What is a Fractal</h3>
					<p>
						A fractal is a mathematically generated object that has similar characteristics no matter what scaling they 
						are displayed at. They are a common phenomenon within nature. Some examples within nature include many trees, flowers, and river deltas such as the Ayeyarwady River Delta.
						Other examples include the Sierpinski Triangle, the Mandelbrot Set, and the Fibonacci Sequence.
						<br>
						Fractals can be genrated in many different ways. One of those ways is with a chaos automaton
					</p>
					<h3>What is a Chaos Automaton</h3>
					<p>
						A chaos automaton is a class of models that can be used in order to transform a 
						piece of data and output a series of coordinate points which, when put together, generate a fractal image.
